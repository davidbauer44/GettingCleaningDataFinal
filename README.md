README.md

This is my final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course.

The code is in a single file, "run_analysis.R".

The output from this script on the input data is the file, "Tidy Data Set.csv".

A text code book describing the tidy data is provided in the file, "CodeBook.md".
Note that large parts of the CodeBook are copy/pasted from the descriptions for the
original data, since they still hold.
